We consider here a bi-dimensional generalization of this process in which at each step, the walker makes a randomly rotated version of one of its past steps. We show that when the reinforcement is strong enough, the walker follows a randomly rotated logarithmic spiral, with Gaussian fluctuations.</p> <p>9H40-10H20 : Serge COHEN, Fragmentation with erasure and expanding intervals With Shambo Saha (Indian Statistical Institute, Baranagar, India) We study sequences of partitions of a non decreasing sequence \\(I_n\\) of intervals into subintervals, starting from the trivial partition, in which each partition is obtained from the one before by splitting its subintervals in two, according to a given rule, and then merging pairs of subintervals at the break points of the old partition. The \\(n\\)th partition then comprises \\(n+1\\) subintervals with \\(n\\) break points. When $ I_n = [0,1] $ is constant,  the empirical distribution of these points was shown to converge weakly to a singular probability supported in ${0,1} $ in a  previous article. When the length of the intervals is regularly varying with a positive index, we show in this article that the limit  can be absolutely continuous.</p> <p>10H40-11H20 : J\u00e9r\u00e9my BOYER, A Lindeberg-Feller Uniform Central Limit Theorems for Non Stationary Empirical Processes We establish an infinite dimensional generalization of the Lindeberg-Feller theorem for triangular arrays. Let \\(X_t\\), \\(t\\in[0,1]\\), be independent random variables with distribution \\(\\mu_t\\) on \\(\\mathcal{X}\\). Given \\(n\\) observation times \\(t\\in T_n\\) and a class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of functions \\(f:\\mathcal{X} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}\\) the empirical measure is \\(P_n(f)=n^{-1}\\sum _{t\\in T_n} f(X_{t})\\). Under regularity conditions on the flow \\(t\\mapsto \\mu_t\\) and the design of experiment \\(n \\mapsto T_n\\) in addition to entropy conditions on \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) we prove that the non stationary empirical process \\(\\Gamma_n=\\sqrt{n}(P_n-\\overline{\\mu}_n)\\) centered at \\(\\overline{\\mu}_n=n^{-1}\\sum _{t\\in T_n} \\mu_{t}\\) weakly converges to a Gaussian process \\(\\G\\). Compared to the Donsker theorem in the stationary case \\(\\mu_t=\\overline{\\mu}_n=\\mu_0\\) \\(\\mathbb{G}\\) is no more a Brownian bridge and has smaller variance. We provide non asymptotic rates of coupling of \\(\\Gamma_n\\) by versions \\(\\mathbb{G}_n\\) of \\(\\mathbb{G}\\). This framework covers many examples of heterogeneous data. </p> <p>11H20-12H00 : Laure COUTIN, TBA Abstract</p> <p>13H20-14H00 : Michel PAIN, Polynomial slowdown in space-inhomogeneous branching Brownian motion  I will present a space-inhomogeneous version of branching Brownian motion in the plane. It is a particle system moving in the plane according to Brownian motions and splitting into two at a rate which depends on their angular coordinates. We will discuss the asymptotic behavior of the position of the particle the furthest away from the origin, and we will see that the inhomogeneity in space can cause a polynomial slowdown. This is a joint work with Julien Berestycki and David Geldbach. </p> <p>14H00-14H40 : Fran\u00e7ois CHAPON, Outliers of perturbations of banded Toeplitz matrices  Toeplitz matrices are non-normal matrices whose spectral properties in high dimensions are now well understood. Their spectra are particularly sensitive to small perturbations. In this talk, we will focus on banded Toeplitz matrices whose symbol is a Laurent polynomial, and which are perturbed by a random matrix. Our goal is to characterize outliers, i.e. eigenvalues that detach from the support of the limiting spectral distribution as the dimension tends to infinity. The emergence of outliers in certain regions of the complex plane is closely linked to the winding number of the curve traced by the symbol in those regions. This is a work in collaboration with Charles Bordenave and Mireille Capitaine.  </p> <p>14H40-15H20 : Tristan BENOIST, Review of some methods of proofs of limit theorems applied to some hidden Markov models  Several methods can be used to proof standard limit theorems (LLN, CLT, Berry-Esseen, LIL, LDP\u2026). I will review some of them with examples of Markov chains and explain how they generalize to some hidden Markov models with unclear state space that appears in quantum mechanics.</p> <p>15H40-16H20 : Jan-Luka FATRAS, The decoupling argument for Large Deviations  In this talk, I will present the decoupling argument for establishing large deviation principles of empirical measures. I will begin with the i.i.d. setting and then show how the argument extends to more general frameworks, including the case of quantum trajectories.</p> <p>16H20-17H00 : Fu-Hsuan HO, The free energy of an enriched continuous random energy model in the weak correlation regime Recently, there has been an attempt to rewrite the free energy of spin glass models as a solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In the talk, I will overview the efforts and the results that several people have achieved. Then, I will talk about an on-going work with Alexander Alban and Justin Ko where we try to apply this framework to the branching random walk setting. In the weak correlation regime, where the CREM\u2019s covariance function A is bounded above by the identity, we show that the free energy is given by the Hopf formula. In contrast, we provide an example outside of the weak regime, where A is a two-segment linear function exceeding the identity. Here, the Hamilton-Jacobi framework no longer applies, and a formal application of the associated variational principle fails to yield the correct free energy.</p>"}]}
